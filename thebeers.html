		<h3>The Titans</h3>
		<div class="deets">These are the original standards. Big, bold, and mostly Belgian.</div>
		<ul>
		<li><span>Tranquility Tripel</span> Apricot, citrus, and spice in a light 8.8% ABV beer that drinks easy like a session beer.<br />Gold Medal 2015 Colorado State Fair.</li>

		<li><span>Scorpiris Saison</span> A healthy dose of late addition Sorachi Ace hops gives this beer a light lemon cream and berry flavor that compliments the peppery yeast esters.</li>

		<li><span>Sanctuary Golden Strong Ale</span> Everyone has their sanctuary. Ours is making beer. This Belgian style beer has complex notes of pear and apple and hides its alcohol well.<br>
		Silver Award 2016 World Beer Cup</li>

		<li><span>Tyndareus Quad</span> Named for the Spartan king father of the Gemini twins, this Belgian-style quadrupel base has notes of caramel, dried fruit and spice. We then age it in Caribbean rum barrels to give it some vanilla and oak flavor. It's finished with just enough cold brewed Ehiopian Sidamo coffee to round it out. Best served in a tulip with an old friend.Let it warm and ponder the universe.</li>

		<li><span>Erebus Imperial Stout</span> Named for the primordial creator of darkness from Greek mythology. We use buckwheat, bamboo honey, meadow foam honey and three kinds of maple syrup.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>The Olympians</h3>
		<div class="deets">Vying for supremacy with the titans, these are a little more playful.</div>
		<ul>
		<li><span>Demeter India Pale Wheat</span>Named for the Greek goddess of the harvest this unfiltered beer is a complex cornucopia of flavors. Mild wheat spice blends with juicy hops and slight yeast banana.</li>
		<li><span>High Note Grisette</span>Named after the Hinaut region it originates from, its a relative of the saison but lighter and more sessionable.<br />
		Gold Medal 2016 Colorado State Fair.</li>
		<li><span>Skinny jeans session IPA</span>For those times when you want a beer with a big burst of hops but want it in a more sessionable form. Tropical and citrus flavors make this an easy drinking IPA.</li>
		
		</ul>
		<h3>Demigods</h3>
		<div class="deets">Collaborations and tests. These showcase our experimental side and rotate frequently.</div>
		<ul>
		<li><span>Pumpkin Latte Stout</span> collaboration with Echo and Gravity</li>

		<li><span>Lemongrass Kottbusser</span> collaboration with 300 Suns Brewing for Collaboration Fest 2016.</li>
		</ul>
