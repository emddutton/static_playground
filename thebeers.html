		<!-- <h3>The Titans</h3>
		<div class="deets">These are the original standards. Big, bold, and mostly Belgian.</div> -->
		<ul>
		<!-- <li><span>Tranquility Tripel</span> Apricot, citrus, and spice in a light 8.8% ABV beer that drinks easy like a session beer.<br />Gold Medal 2015 Colorado State Fair.</li>
 -->

		<li><span>Sanctuary Golden Strong Ale</span> Everyone has their sanctuary. Ours is making beer. This Belgian style beer has complex notes of pear and apple and hides its alcohol well.<br>
		Silver Award 2016 World Beer Cup</li>

		<!-- <li><span>Tyndareus Quad</span> Named for the Spartan king father of the Gemini twins, this Belgian-style quadrupel base has notes of caramel, dried fruit and spice. We then age it in Caribbean rum barrels to give it some vanilla and oak flavor. It's finished with just enough cold brewed Ehiopian Sidamo coffee to round it out. Best served in a tulip with an old friend.Let it warm and ponder the universe. Gold Medal 2016 All Colorado Beer Festival. </li> -->

		<!-- <li><span>Erebus Imperial Stout</span> Named for the primordial creator of darkness from Greek mythology. We use buckwheat, bamboo honey, meadow foam honey and three kinds of maple syrup. Silver Medal 2017 Los Angelese Beer Competition.</li> -->
		</ul>

		<!-- <h3>The Olympians</h3>
		<div class="deets">Vying for supremacy with the titans, these are a little more playful.</div> -->
		<ul>
		<li><span>High Note Grisette</span>Named after the Hainaut region it originates from, its a relative of the saison but lighter and more sessionable.<br />
		Gold Medal 2016 Colorado State Fair.</li>
		<li><span>Skinny jeans session IPA</span>For those times when you want a beer with a big burst of hops but want it in a more sessionable form. Tropical and citrus flavors make this an easy drinking IPA.</li>
		<!-- <li><span>Archimedes Rotating Single Hop</span>Named for the ancient Greek scientist, this beer highlights our curiosity and experimental side.  Branching out from the SMASH (Single Malt and Single Hop) we use a different malt, hop and yeast every time.</li> -->
		<li><span>Pulsar Imperial Red Ale</span>A supernova sized explosion of hops married up with rich caramel and toffee malt notes. </li>
		<!-- <li><span>Eurynome Blonde Ale</span>Euronyme was the Greek goddess of flowery pastures. Orange peel, floral hops and belgian yeast make this blonde ale easy drinking.  Pairs well with singing "The Sound of Music" in a mountain field.</li> -->
		</ul>
