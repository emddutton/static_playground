		<!-- <h3>The Titans</h3>
		<div class="deets">These are the original standards. Big, bold, and mostly Belgian.</div> -->
		<ul>
		<!-- <li><span>Tranquility Tripel</span> Apricot, citrus, and spice in a light 8.8% ABV beer that drinks easy like a session beer.<br />Gold Medal 2015 Colorado State Fair.</li>
 -->

		<li><span>Sanctuary Golden Strong Ale</span> Everyone has their sanctuary. Ours is making beer. This Belgian style beer has complex notes of pear and apple and hides its alcohol well.<br>
		Silver Award 2016 World Beer Cup</li>
			
		<li><span>Erebus Imperial Honey Maple Stout</span>Named for the Greek primordial god of darkness, this beer is part of our “Olympians” premium line of limited release beers.  It is rich and roasty with complex layers of nuttiness and chocolate. Does not drink like a thirteen percent beer.<br />
		Silver Medal 2016 Los Angeles International Beer Competition</li>

		<!-- <li><span>Tyndareus Quad</span> Named for the Spartan king father of the Gemini twins, this Belgian-style quadrupel base has notes of caramel, dried fruit and spice. We then age it in Caribbean rum barrels to give it some vanilla and oak flavor. It's finished with just enough cold brewed Ehiopian Sidamo coffee to round it out. Best served in a tulip with an old friend.Let it warm and ponder the universe. Gold Medal 2016 All Colorado Beer Festival. </li> -->

		<li><span>Twin Ninja Sake Saison</span>This one was brewed with our friends at 300 Suns Brewing in Longmont. We used rice hulls and sake yeast to put a light, fun spin on the traditional saison.</li>
		
		<li><span>Signal Mirror	American Amber</span>Full bodied red with just the right amount of hop bite to it.</li>

		<li><span>Overdue Vacation Pale Lager</span>A light and refreshing lager with Azacca hops to give it a bit of citrus and pineapple flavor.</li>
	
		<li><span>West of Munich Amber Lager</span>Smooth, malty, easy, and delicious. </li>
		</ul>

		<!-- <h3>The Olympians</h3>
		<div class="deets">Vying for supremacy with the titans, these are a little more playful.</div> -->
		<ul>
		
		<!-- <li><span>Archimedes Rotating Single Hop</span>Named for the ancient Greek scientist, this beer highlights our curiosity and experimental side.  Branching out from the SMASH (Single Malt and Single Hop) we use a different malt, hop and yeast every time.</li> -->
		
		<!-- <li><span>Eurynome Blonde Ale</span>Euronyme was the Greek goddess of flowery pastures. Orange peel, floral hops and belgian yeast make this blonde ale easy drinking.  Pairs well with singing "The Sound of Music" in a mountain field.</li> -->
		</ul>
