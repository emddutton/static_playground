<p>Gemini Beer Company is owned and operated by husband and wife Chris and Beth Dutton.  It's a labor of love.  Love of good beer.  Love of good food.  Love of friends to share both with.
Yes, they are both Geminis.  They are also, like many Coloradans, originally from somewhere else.  Gemini is the manifestation of that duality many of us share in our hearts and spirits.</p>

<p>Craft beer has always been an allure for Chris dating back to college when found money meant splurging on Saranac and an extra Taco Bell bean burrito.</p>

<p>His switch to brewing beer started with his passion for crafting food.  When given the opportunity for four-day work weeks he spent his Mondays off watching food channel and making his wife surprise dinners.  Leftovers came to work to be shared with co-workers.  One of these co-workers thought he might like brewing beer and gave him his old homebrewing equipment.  Chris's response at the time was "this looks like a pain in the ass" and he left it in his basement for five years.  Eventually another co-worker found him out, took him to a homebrew store to get the ingredients to make a Fat Tire clone.  He was hooked from there.</p>

<p>Chris has been brewing passionately both professionally and at home ever since.  That original devotion to quality food is still there and sometimes manifests itself in his beer.  Look for food inspired one offs like deconstructed Mississippi Mud Pie Brown Ale and various candy bars in beer form. </p>
